# Coding Qustions Practice

Welcome to my coding practice repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily coding practice progress on various coding platforms. I aim to solve at least 4 problems each day from Coding Studio, LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Codeforces. Additionally, I'll be updating my learning progress in Android development in a separate repository.

## Daily Coding Goals

1. **Coding Studio**
2. **LeetCode**
3. **GeeksforGeeks**
4. **Codeforces**

Solving at least 4 problems daily and document them in the `gfg`, `leetcode`, `coding studio` and `code forces` folders respectively.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific coding platform.

- coding-studio/
- leetcode/
- gfg/
- codeforces/
- [android development](https://github.com/Cyb3rGhoul/android-dev.git)
- README.md

## Daily Logs

I will maintain daily logs in each platform's folder to track my progress and the problems I've solved. These logs will include problem statements, my solutions, and any insights gained during the process.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the daily logs and solutions in each platform's folder. You can use this repository to:
- Track my daily progress in coding practice.
- Review solutions and approaches to problems.
- Contribute: If you have better solutions or additional problems, feel free to contribute!
